The national anthem of the U.S. is "The Star Spangled Banner."
In  the mid 19th century, a movement formed promoting the adoption
of a song with a less war-like
theme, perhaps  "America the Beautiful." Polls showed, though,
that the masses preferred to retain the traditional anthem. By
the way, there are 11 occurrences of the string "the" in this file,
52 distinct words, and 69 total words.
